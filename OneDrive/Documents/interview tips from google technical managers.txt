TPM is a very unique role in that, for me specifically, it's stretching me to pull
0:12
me out of my default, which is just diving through the technical.
0:15
It forces me to come out of that and think higher level,
0:19
bigger picture, is this the best thing long-term?
0:22
As well as being able to balance business and technical decisions.
0:26
That's the part that's really unique about it.
0:28
I come from a software engineering background,
0:30
but over the years I realized that I like to talk to people more
0:34
than sitting in my desk and code.
0:36
This is a good mix where I can work with people, find out what the problems are,
0:40
and then work with the SWEs and the engineering team
0:42
to have them implement it.
0:44
So it's a dual language process if you will.
0:46
Those capabilities often are portable
0:49
to a variety of different areas and different types of projects.
0:52
It's really a passkey to be able to go anywhere in Google and work on
0:56
anything that interests you.
1:01
For a TPM position, you'll typically talk to somewhere
1:03
between three and five people when you visit.
1:06
Frequently there will be one person who is specifically assigned
1:10
to assess the T, the technical aspect of TPM.
1:14
Often that's software engineering, but at Google it could mean anything.
1:17
Most of the questions which they asked me are things
1:20
which are very relevant to my job today.
1:22
Half of them were technical design focus,
1:24
and the other half were more on the program management side of things.
1:27
What they try to assess in the interview is your ability to solve problems,
1:31
it's your ability to interact with cross-functional teams.
1:36
How do you lead without managing people?
1:39
Those types of things.
1:43
One thing in particular that's very important is to make sure
1:46
that you don't answer a behavioral question about
1:49
how you did something in the past with a hypothetical answer
1:52
of I would do this or that.
1:54
It happens quite a lot, but it's really important
1:56
to really draw in your experience and show that you've been able
1:59
successfully to do the things that you're being asked about.
2:02
I try to find things that I've done in three categories:
2:05
the most difficult things I've done.
2:07
Then the second thing I looked at was what are my biggest successes,
2:11
what were my biggest accomplishments, things that I'm proud of.
2:14
And the last one was what were my failures.
2:17
So those are the three things I really focused on.
2:19
I think one of the things that helped me was to really think about
2:22
the questions and the problems that were presented to me
2:25
and the five why's of who, what, when, where, and why.
2:27
And another thing was just not being afraid to get on the whiteboard
2:31
and to write things out.
2:32
Even when you're not necessarily writing numbers and code on the board,
2:36
but just trying to organize your thoughts
2:38
and bucketing ways to solve a given problem.
2:41
I did a lot of technical preparation just going through and reading up on my design
2:45
and stuff like that, but then later I realized
2:48
I really got to practice my mock interviews.
2:50
It's literally your 45 minutes of sales pitch, and you have to get it right.
2:54
All the things that are important for project managers or program managers
2:58
such as organization, communication,
3:00
ability to simplify something down to a solvable puzzle,
3:05
is very important in the job and it's important in the interview itself as well.
3:09
I think the thing that was least productive was just the self-doubt,
3:14
but I just convinced myself that I was very confident
3:17
in what I was bringing to the table, and things worked out well.
3:21
You will never find out what you're missing on
3:23
until you apply and you go through the process.
3:26
So I just thought I'd apply and see what happens,
3:28
and I was really glad that I got this.
