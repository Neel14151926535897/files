Found a role you're excited about?
0:03
Then it's time to build your resume,
0:05
filled with data and tailored to the role you want.
0:08
A great resume should speak to both your skills
0:11
and the requirements of the job you're looking at.
0:14
Think of each section of your resume as a building block
0:17
with each block containing information about you
0:20
and what you've accomplished.
0:22
This can include a career summary, experience, education,
0:26
certifications and awards, or skills.
0:29
You can arrange them depending on your experience
0:32
and what the position calls for.
0:34
For instance, if you're a recent graduate,
0:37
you may want to feature your education up top.
0:39
If you're not, or you don't have a degree —
0:42
they aren't required for most roles —
0:44
Consider putting that block towards the bottom.
0:47
It's important to create a resume that's as unique as you.
0:51
Our jobs are specific,
0:52
and the kind of person who can succeed in the role isn't generic.
0:56
Look closely at the description of the job you want.
0:59
What experience does it require?
1:02
Do you have it?
1:03
Great! Move it up in the mix.
1:05
Are there specific keywords the job description keeps repeating?
1:09
Make sure you include those in your resume.
1:12
Here at Google, we're always looking at data.
1:14
So when you tell us about something you've accomplished,
1:17
try to include data that shows the impact you made
1:20
and how it ties to the role you want.
1:22
If we think about this as a formula, here's an equation that might be helpful:
1:27
Accomplished X as measured by Y doing Z.
1:31
For example, increased tail wags of Dooglers by 75% over two days,
1:37
by placing treats outside of conference rooms.
1:40
There are no hard and fast rules,
1:42
except when it comes to spelling and grammar.
1:44
Move the blocks around until you've created a shape
1:47
that best expresses who you are,
1:49
and why you're the best person for the job.
