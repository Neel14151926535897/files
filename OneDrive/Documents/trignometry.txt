4:35
trigonometry if we look at a triangle we
4:37
will see this angle in trigonometry it's
4:40
called Theta these sides have a
4:42
particular ratio to one another based on
4:44
the value of the angle Theta and are
4:45
labeled hypotenuse opposite and adjacent
4:48
there are three functions that pretty
4:49
much sum up all of trigonometry actually
4:52
there's one more thing too but we'll get
4:54
to that later the sin function tells us
4:56
the ratio between the opposite and the
4:58
hypotenuse the coast function tells us
5:00
the ratio between adjacent and the
5:01
hypotenuse and the tan function tells us
5:03
the ratio between opposite and the
5:05
adjacent imagine a triangle with these
5:07
values by using the sin function and
5:09
then calculating it as an equation we
5:11
can then find the value for x which
5:13
equals 6.88 the other key thing to
5:15
remember is this little circle divided
5:17
into four quadrants with 12 points
5:19
called a unit circle the points in the
5:21
circle are defined by various
5:22
measurements like for example degrees
5:25
but the most common measurement however
5:26
is radians which basically is the radius
5:29
of the circle stretched out over its
5:30
side creating an arc 6.28 3 radians make
5:33
up a whole circle which is equal to the
5:35
circumference of the circle 2 pi radius
5:38
but since we only use radians as the
5:40
measurement and not the radius we can
5:42
rename 2 pi radius to 2 pi radians yeah
5:45
I know they literally sound the same
5:47
deal with it congratulations now that we
5:49
know the circle in total is 2 pi radians
5:51
we can also say that the points in our
5:53
Circle become various fractions of pi
5:55
over radians now here is when things get
5:58
kind of freaky if we draw draw a line
6:00
from the center of the circle this line
6:01
according to trigonometry will have the
6:03
unit one one what you may ask just one
6:06
yeah you see since we're dealing with
6:08
ratios between lengths they'll cancel
6:10
each other out therefore we just use one
6:12
if we know that this length is one unit
6:14
long we can also figure out that the end
6:16
of each axis have these coordinates now
6:18
let's place this angle Theta in the
6:19
circle and draw one line alongside the
6:21
x-axis and then another one from the
6:23
point where the angle intercepts the
6:24
circle wait a minute that's the same
6:26
triangle we drew earlier this side AKA
6:29
the hypotenuse will have the unit one if
6:31
we look at the functions sin Co and tan
6:34
we can then plug our values into one of
6:35
them and then simplify it do you see
6:37
what's going on here we're marking out
6:38
the coordinates for the angle Theta in
6:40
simple terms we're figuring out the
6:42
lengths of the triangle sides knowing
6:44
this we can then say that the
6:45
coordinates for the angle Theta are cos
6:47
Theta comma sin Theta now to most normal
6:49
people this tells us about as much as
6:51
this kid trying to explain his dream so
6:54
we're going to need some actual numbers
6:56
the three key numbers to remember are
6:57
square 3 over 2 square2 2 and square 1/
7:01
2 which is simplified to 1/ 2 remember
7:03
those dots in the circle representing
7:05
the fractions of 2 pi radians turns out
7:08
if we draw a right triangle with a 30°
7:10
angle to pi/ 6 radians then draw a
7:12
mirror image triangle below it we can
7:14
then see that the length of the original
7:16
line aka the wide coordinate AKA sin
7:19
Theta = 1 2 you see there's a pattern
7:22
here if we instead draw a triangle with
7:24
a 45° angle to pi over 4 radians we will
7:27
see indeed that sin Theta equal 2 / 2
7:30
doing the same with a triangle with the
7:32
angle 60° to pk/ 3 radians will give us
7:35
the conclusion that sin theta equals to
7:37
square 3/ 2 long line big number medium
7:40
line medium number Short Line small
7:42
number and the same pattern applies to
7:44
co Theta fun fact we can actually draw
7:46
out the function of Co and sin in a
7:48
graph it shows us the variation of Co
7:50
and sin with respect to the angle Theta
7:52
you can think of Co Theta as the x axis
7:54
when Theta increases so does the co
7:56
Theta line until Theta goes over the
7:58
second quadrant which sits on the
7:59
negative side of cos Theta making the
8:01
line slope down sin Theta pretty much
8:03
does the same thing just in reverse all
